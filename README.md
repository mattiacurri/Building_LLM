# Building LLM from scratch

Documenting and sharing the code developed as I progress through the book [*Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)*](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch?a_aid=raschka&a_bid=4c2437a0&chan=mm_website) by [Sebastian Raschka](https://github.com/rasbt). This repository serves as a hands-on companion to the book, with code implementations that follow the chapters and concepts presented in the text. Obviously, the code will be similar to the original repo associated with the book with minor changes/experiment of mine.

Original repository of the book: [LLMs-from-scratch](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch).
